Project Scope:

This project is seeking to develop an e-commerce platform that will facilitate online sales transactions using Visa and Mastercard payment methods. The platform will offer a diverse range of products from various vendors, with each vendor being responsible for maintaining their respective product listings. To ensure efficient management of the platform, a reporting module will be incorporated to enable vendors and management to monitor the status of sales in terms of products and dollar value.

The platform's administration will be handled by a system administrator who will have the authority to manage user roles and access levels. The system will employ role-based access control, utilizing the Active Directory (AD) feature for Windows authentication. All data within the platform will be stored in a secure database, ensuring that confidentiality and integrity are maintained.

To ensure that product listings are of high quality, the system administrator will be required to approve all products before they can appear on the platform. Additionally, new vendors will be required to pay a one-time registration fee of $20,000.

To promote a sustainable business model, profits generated from sales will be shared between vendors and the shopping cart system, with vendors receiving 80% and the platform receiving 20%. In addition, an SMTP module will be integrated into the platform to enable automated emails to be sent to purchasing users and delivering vendors.

Overall, our objective is to provide a robust, secure, and reliable e-commerce platform that will enable efficient online transactions and promote the growth and sustainability of the business.
